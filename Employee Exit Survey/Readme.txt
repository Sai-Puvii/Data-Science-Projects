We will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE). In this project, we will play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

Are employees who only worked for the institute for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. We will aim to do most of the data cleaning and get started with analyzing the first question.

Below is a preview of the columns we will work with from the dete_survey.csv:

ID: An id used to identify the participant
SeparationType: The reason why the employment ended
Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended
DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE
