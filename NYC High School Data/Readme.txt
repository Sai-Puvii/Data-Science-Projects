One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they are unfair to certain groups.

The Scholastic Aptitude Test(SAT), is an exam taken by U.S. high school students before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 points maximum. The combined score is 2,400 for all the sections. Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

Given the prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to consider. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For instance, if certain racial groups consistently perform better, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.
